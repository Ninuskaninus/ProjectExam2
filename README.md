# Holidaze - Accommodation Booking Site

## Project Exam 2

### Goal
The goal of this project is to showcase the skills and knowledge gained over the past two years by developing a comprehensive front-end application for a newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze. The project should demonstrate both visual and technical capabilities.

### Brief
Holidaze has approached us to develop a brand new front end for their accommodation booking application. The design and user experience are open to interpretation based on the required features provided. The project involves two main aspects: 
1. The customer-facing side where users can book holidays at a venue.
2. The admin-facing side where users can register and manage venues and bookings.

### Requirements
